# Day 1 Notes

## Bulding an API
An API is an "Application Programming Interface"
    - An interface that program code uses
    - Compared to a UI (User Interface)
        - UI is code that user interacts with directly.

As APPLICATION DEVELOPERS 
    - The interface is the first, most important thing.
    - Does it do the *right thing* and does it do it *right*.
