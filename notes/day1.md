# Day 1 Notes

# Building an API

An API is an "Application Programming Interface"
    - An interface that program code uses
    - Compared to a UI (User Interface)
        - UI is code that user interacts with directly

As Application Developers
    - The interface is the first, most important thing
    - Does it do the right thing and does it do it right?

Services are stateless

Containers make sure program doesn't affect anything on cp
