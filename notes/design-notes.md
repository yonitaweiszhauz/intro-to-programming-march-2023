# Four Rules of Simple Design

1. Passes the tests - External Quality First (you know how to solve the problem!)
2. Reveals intention - We spend more time reading code than writing code. 
3. No duplication  - remove duplication.
4. Fewest elements - 
    - variables (mutable data)
    - decisions (if statements)
    - deeply nested stuff - loops inside of nested four levels of if statements.



Embarassing Things:

- Bugs scale linearly with the number of lines of code. (periodt)
- not nearly enough women and minorities, etc. etc.

Refactoring:
    - 15 = 10 + 5
    - 15 = 5 * 3
    - 15 = 15
    - ? = 12 + 4

"modifying code without tests isn't refactoring, it's just changing stuff and hoping it works".


"Legacy Software"
    - Any software that doesn't have tests.
    - live in fear of this software.
