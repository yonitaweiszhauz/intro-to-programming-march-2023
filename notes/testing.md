# Testing Notes


1. You must have tests for your code.
    - You can not write enough tests to ensure you have no "bugs"
        - "Risk Based Testing"
            - "risky" - how likely would this be to fail * how costly would that be.
    - "How many tests should we write?"
        - "Enough that you have confidence that you can ship the code" - "Professional Integrity"


## Simple vs Complex vs. Complicated
- Rich Hickey (creator of the Clojure)
- Simple vs. Easy

"Easy" - close at hand.
"Simple" - the opposite of complex
    - it does one thing, has one "responsibility" - is in charge of one thing.
    - "each code module should have a single axis (reason) to change"
"complex" - made up of more than one thing.

"in object oriented programming everything happens somewhere else"
