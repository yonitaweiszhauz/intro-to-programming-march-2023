# How to Get My (Jeff's) Code into your Repository

*After* I push new code to my repository into the "instructor" folder, go to YOUR Github repo (in your browser).

You should see something *close* to this:

![Github1](../images/gh1.png)


The account should be your Github Account (#1 above). 

Click the "Sync Fork" link (#2)

This will copy the stuff I have that you don't into your Github repository.

Then, in Visual Studio Code, go to the Source Control extension, click the ellipses in the title bar, and select "pull".

This will pull down the new changes to your local machine.

Note: You can also do this pull by using the command prompt and typing `git pull`
