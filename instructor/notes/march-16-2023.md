## Resource Oriented Architecture
HTTP APIs 
- HTTP - Created by Tim Berners-Lee
- REST - Roy T. Fielding
    - REST - links
- "RESTful" APIs


- Definition of a resource: An important thingy we are exposing through our API
- Identifiers (Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs)) - http://localhost:1340/learning-items

- https://api.company.com/employees/93893
- https://api.company.com/employee-of-the-month

- FIXED set of behaviors.

### The Ones we Use Mostly for APIs

#### Resource Types
    - Collection
        - GET /employees
    - Documents
        - GET /employes/938398

- GET (like SQL Select)
    - 
- POST (like SQL Insert)
    - Collection
        POST /employees
        Hey collection, please consider making this I'm sending one your subordinate resources.
    - Document (pretty rare)
        "Submit this for processing"
        POST /employees/938398

- PUT - Is Not Like SQL Update At All.
    - Collection - replace the collection with this new stuff
    - Document - replace this document with this new thing.
    
- DELETE (like SQL Delete)
    - Make it so this resource no longer exists.
    - DELETE /employees/938398 

SQL (Data Manipulation Language)
SELECT
INSERT 
UPDATE
    - UPDATE employees set pay=8000 where id = 938389 and pay = 7000
DELETE 

### Other Occassional Use
- OPTIONS - CORS
- HEAD - Like a GET request, but don't me any data. (Just the status code and the headers)
    - GET /users?email=bob@aol
    - HEAD /users?email=bob@aol.com
        - 200 Ok
        - 404 NotFound

### Non-Standard Http Methods (RFC 2616)
- PATCH
    - Partial Updates of Resources
        - I think this sucks. Don't do it.
