# Good Morning! It's MONDAY March 13, 2023


## Today / This Week

**BUILD STUFF**

This week is going to be about two things:

- Applying the stuff we've learned to build applications, including deploying
- Extending what we've learned within the context of application development

Important note: You should focus on learning to be an efficient programmer - the stuff we did last week.
Your particular role here at Progressive will likely include some of what we are doing here this week, 
however you will get additional training on the specific topics. This is "preview" of what you will be
doing and learning.
