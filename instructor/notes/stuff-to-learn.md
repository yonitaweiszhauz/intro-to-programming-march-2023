Notes:

Looks like about five people didn't make this note. ;(

This isn't a fast food job. It will take you *way* longer than a couple of weeks to get comfortable. Learn to embrace that.
*However*, you have to be responsible for your own career growth.

Making a "Log" 
    - Successes / what you've done, what you've learned
    - What you need work on.
    - Tend to it like a garden.
    - Discuss with your mentors / managers
    - Use it at your 1:1, reviews, etc.



## Command Prompt
- Scott Hanselman's Video
- The File System
- Pick your shell
  - Powershell
  - CMD
  - Bash / Zsh / Fsh etc.
- You use the shell to:
  - Access the file system / navigate
  - Run commands (git, ng, etc.)
  - Scripting - automating repetitive tasks
  
## Angular
    - What the heck is it? What are we doing with it? Why is it used?
        - Angular is a FRAMEWORK that we use to build applications that download and run in a web browser.
        - It isn't particularly good or useful for creating "websites"

    - Assumed Tacit Knowledge - 
        - [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)
        - [TypeScript Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmxwicpROps)
        - HTML (Good Structure, Semantics, Etc - Accessibility)
        - CSS - "Good Enough"
        - Using Frameworks / Design Systems / Etc.
        - Frameworks:
            - Bootstrap - the very least I could use.
            - Angular Material
            - Tailwind - claims - 
        - Browser as an Application Development Environment
        - a *lot* of this is hidden/abstracted away in Angular, but *some* knowledge is helpful.
        - Some JavaScript - TypeScript
        - Matt Pocock's Video / Gary Bernhardt https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YmxwicpROps https://www.executeprogram.com/
        - Training

        - maybe traininga at PGR eventually - up in the air.
        - mentoring.
        - Mozilla Developer Network
