## Training Resources

### Angular Stuff

Jeff's Youtube videos:

- Counter as a Kata: [Intro to Redux 1 Basic State with @NGRX/Store - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krcq6-KefFs&list=PLTEnldLBlMMxLmS7CtpAl_BXtAPi5K5Rc)
- Counter with Angular 15 Standalone Components (advanced?) - [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTvAXfqXEOXPVI_lBehWWS4pcxy4swZbo)

### C# Stuff

[Learn .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn)

[Nick Chapsas](https://www.youtube.com/@nickchapsas) - Great stuff - remind yourself to verify what is good for applications developers, vs. systems/library programming.

[Code Opinion](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeOpinion) Software architecture stuff.

[Steve Smith / Ardalis](https://ardalis.com/) Great resources - 



### Linux

You don't have to be a super Linux hacker, but having *some* familiarity with the Linux operating system, including the file system, basic shell commands, and a bit of networking will remove quite a bit of friction from you work, and come in handy when building container.

The training available from the [Linux Foundation](https://training.linuxfoundation.org) is fantastic. Much of it is free, but they also offer advanced courses and certification in Linux and Cloud Native technologies. (The Cloud Native Computing Foundation is a "child" of the Linux Foundation).

Their course on [Introduction to Linux (LFS101x)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/introduction-to-linux/) is fantastic.

## General Topics

### Hanselman

I'm a huge fan of [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/). He's a Microsoft guy, and is getting a reputation as the "Mr. Rogers" of the programming world. Kind, clear, humorous, and intelligent. 

His blog (linked above), and his [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL-fHOdarou-CR2XUmK48Og) is fantastic.

I particularly like his series [Computer Stuff they Didn't Teach You](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0M0zPgJ3HSesuPIObeUVQNbKqlw5U2Vr) series. 

Videos in this series I found particularly useful:

- [How do you use the Command line?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKBcHuA3VJE&list=PL0M0zPgJ3HSesuPIObeUVQNbKqlw5U2Vr&index=13)
    - ‚≠ê **REALLY**. Watch this. I see so many *super* developers stumble around like drunk people when presented with a shell. This is a super, low-effort, way to increase your confidence as a developer. Just spend a little time learning this and your confidence (and skills) will go through the roof.
- [Git 101 Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBg9mlpzEYU&list=PL0M0zPgJ3HSesuPIObeUVQNbKqlw5U2Vr&index=4&t=854s)
    - Actually, ALL of his GIT stuff is super. Watch it all.
- [Basic Text Editing in VS Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSMyLMZYjz8&list=PL0M0zPgJ3HSesuPIObeUVQNbKqlw5U2Vr&index=3&t=727s)


You know what - going through the list, they are ALL good. Just go through the list and see what strikes your fancy. 

### DevOps

#### That DevOps Guy
For general DevOps topics, I like [That DevOps Guy](https://www.youtube.com/c/MarcelDempers). One of the things I really appreciate about him is that he maintains a Github repo (linked on his channel) with all his sample code, etc. 

#### DevOps Simply Explained (TechWorld with Nana)

Great Kubernetes resources. She really goes into depth when needed, and has lots of shorter videos. [Techworld with Nana](https://www.youtube.com/c/TechWorldwithNana) is rad. Mash that subscribe button! Hit the bell to be notified of new content! You know the drill!

#### Honorable Mentions

[Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts): I have learned *so much* from Gary over the years. Absolutely brilliant stuff.  His most famous video [Wat](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat) is a bit dated but will give you a sense of what you are dealing with here. Laugh out loud funny. His talk on [Boundaries](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/boundaries) is one of the most clarifying talks on software architecture I've seen. (It is expanded on in [Functional Core Imperative Shell](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell)). The concepts he presents here are *key* to modern software architecture, including Angular, and services. I find them particularly helpful if you are trying to get your head around Apache Kafka (they are frequently referenced in books and papers on Kafka).  

[Execute Program](https://www.executeprogram.com/) is a online training site by Gary. You get 16 free lessons, or can pay for more and WOW are they good. Gary has *really* thought about how to deliver training for developers that is useful and "sticks". Great stuff for TypeScript, SQL, JavaScript, and his Regular Expressions course will give you super powers.

[Jeremy Miller](https://jeremydmiller.com/) is a long-time Microsoft-centered developer. His blog is fantastic. His recent post of [Creating Conditions for Developer Happiness](https://jeremydmiller.com/2022/01/27/creating-the-conditions-for-developer-happiness/) is really brilliant and helpful and mirrors and extends a lot of my thinking and motivation as a trainer (I want you to be happy!). I particularly enjoy his thoughts on software developer testing. If you've taken testing courses from me, you'll have heard me quote him often.

[Just Me and OpenSource](https://www.youtube.com/c/wenkatn-justmeandopensource) has a lot of good videos on Kubernetes and other topics.

[Learn LinuxTV](https://www.youtube.com/c/LearnLinuxtv) is good geeky stuff.

[Computer Science with Sy's Cats](https://www.youtube.com/c/SyBrandPlusCats) Just so darned entertaining. They even got me to write a little C++ code again (I had sworn off C++ back in the '90's at about the same time I swore off tequila and slightly before going sober from XML). Sy demonstrates advanced programming concepts. With cats. Excellent teacher, communicator, and technologist.

[Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/) - I just really dig this guy. It's a lot of JavaScript and react stuff, but his testing stuff has *changed my life, man*. Give him a visit.

[CNCF Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/cloudnativefdn) - great stuff from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
    - [Kubernetes/Container Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuaoVUD-TJU) is a great one to review from time to time. Ian Coldwater is brilliant and they produce a ton of content. If you have insomnia, just google that name and devour everything they have produced.


If you really want to geek out, I suggest learning a bit of the Go programming language. You don't have to become a master (unless you want to!), but learning a bit of the language and the idiomatic way it is used will give you great insight into so much of the architecture of Cloud Native software and platforms (much of it was written in Go.) [Here's the Go Homepage](https://go.dev/)

Maybe don't binge Community for the 5th time and watch or dig into some of this stuff instead. 

Let me know your favorites. I'll check them out and add them to the list!
