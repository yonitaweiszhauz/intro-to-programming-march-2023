# Testing Notes


1. You must have tests for your code.
    - You can not write enough tests to ensure you have no "bugs"
        - "Risk Based Testing"
            - "risky" - how likely would this be to fail * how costly would that be.
    - "How many tests should we write?"
        - "Enough that you have confidence that you can ship the code" - "Professional Integrity"
